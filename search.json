This project achieved at minimum 40 parts-per-billion (ppb) long-term frequency accuracy (limited by testing device).\n\n\nSystem ArchitectureThe system consists of several key components:\nCore Hardware\nMicrocontroller: STM32F030 running at 48MHz\nOCXO: CTI OC12SC36 with ±20ppm initial accuracy (salvaged from used signal generator)\nGPS Module: u-blox NEO-6M with 1PPS output\nDAC: 12-bit DAC7563\nDAC: CDCV304PWR(REV1) &#x2F; LMK1C1104(REV2)\n\n\n\nControl AlgorithmThe heart of the system is a custom diverging control algorithm with dead-zone handling:\nstatic uint16_t current_dac = 0x8000;void set_dac(int inc) &#123;  current_dac += inc &lt;&lt; 4;  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(ADC_CS_GPIO_Port, ADC_CS_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);  uint8_t d[3] = &#123;8, current_dac &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xff, current_dac &amp; 0xff&#125;;  HAL_SPI_Transmit(&amp;hspi1, d, 3, 0);  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(ADC_CS_GPIO_Port, ADC_CS_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET);&#125;void update_dac() &#123;  int sum = 0;  for (int i = 0; i &lt; RING_SIZE; i++) &#123;    sum += ring[i];  &#125;  set_dac(-sum / RING_SIZE);&#125;\n\nThe algorithm uses a ring buffer to average phase measurements, implementing a form of PI control with adjustable gain.\nTechnical Challenges &amp; SolutionsChallenge 1: Component SubstitutionWhen my specified clock buffer went out of stock, I selected a pin-compatible alternative without thoroughly reviewing the datasheet. The replacement lacked internal pull-up resistors on the enable pin, resulting in unpredictable behavior.\nSolution: Hot-wired a jumper directly to the PCB - a reminder that every datasheet detail matters!\nChallenge 2: Control Loop InstabilityInitial testing revealed oscillation in the control loop when the OCXO approached lock.\nSolution: Getting rid of PID, I developed a custom diverging algorithm with dead-zone control. When phase error falls within ±2 counts, the system stops adjusting, preventing hunting behavior.\n\n\nMeasurement ResultsTesting was performed using Keysight CXA signal analyzer and EXG vector signal generator as reference.\n\n\nThe spectrum analysis shows:\n\nCenter Frequency: 10.000000 MHz (exact)\nOutput Power: +12.06 dBm\nPhase Noise: Better than -70 dBc&#x2F;Hz at 1Hz offset (limited by testing equipment)\n\n\n\nWith a 10Hz span and 1Hz resolution bandwidth, the signal shows excellent short-term stability with no visible sidebands or spurious content.\nPCB Design NotesThe PCB was designed in Altium Designer with the following considerations:\n\n4-layer stackup: Signal-Ground-Power-Signal for optimal EMI performance\nThermal isolation: The OCXO section is thermally isolated from the MCU and GPS module\nStar grounding: Analog and digital grounds meet at a single point under the DAC\nControlled impedance: 50Ω traces for the RF output path\n\nFuture Improvements\nKalman Filter Implementation: Replace the simple averaging with a Kalman filter for better noise rejection\nCustom PCB Rev 2: Fix the thermal issues with proper copper pour optimization  \nGPS Holdover: Add a rubidium backup for GPS signal loss scenarios\nRemote Monitoring: Add WiFi&#x2F;Ethernet for SNMP-based monitoring\n\nApplicationsThis GPSDO is suitable for:\n\nAmateur radio frequency calibration\nTest equipment reference\nTime-nuts experiments\nSDR frequency stabilization\n\nResources\nSchematic: Available on request\nFirmware: GitHub Repository (coming soon)\n\n\nHave questions about this project?
